# Starts on 21st February, 2022

Low-code needs no introduction anymore, it’s out there, helping small, midsize, and large businesses turn their ideas into digital products with speed and scale. The next round of success belongs to the low-code play that allows developers to leverage composability and the ability to ship out products that can compete in the game of brilliant user experiences; accessible from anywhere. 
We think WaveMaker has a great footing, and with ReactNative upgrade, we are now positioned to offer developers the fair chance to make enterprise-grade and commercial-grade mobile applications that truly wow the end user.
Moving to ReactNative is a massive leap for WaveMaker. React Native is an extension of the mobile development capabilities for WaveMaker..

ReactNative is a cross-platform development framework for mobile applications that delivers a native and responsive experience in performance and behavior on iOS and Android devices.
It also keeps security threats at bay as compared to Cordova or other webview based frameworks. It is open-source and is nurtured by a healthy developer community. There are a host of React Native plugins developed by third-party developers as well. 
With the backing of Facebook (now Meta) and developers, React Native framework has long-term sustainability. 

To develop fully Native apps, you do not need additional programming skills for iOS or Android or separate teams of developers maintaining two different codebases. React Native provides platform-specific versions of components such that a single codebase can be shared across platforms. Isn’t that fantastic?  And more so, to develop React Native apps, WaveMaker developers, who are already well versed in the tool, do not need to learn anything new. 
So, with this Hackathon, we handover the beta version of WaveMaker React Native Studio in your hands, and invite all of you to play with our shiny new toy!  And while you're at it, have loads of fun. We encourage you to experiment and uncover bugs along the journey. This heralds a new era for us, and it is also a test of our capabilities as a product company. 
Off to you talented humans! Run with it…
